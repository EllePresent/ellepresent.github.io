This project was a present for my girlfriend. I initially drew the
images using pencil and paper, and traced over what I drew with a thin
sharpie. Afterwards, I scanned the images and used photoshop to color them.
The original lines where then cut out. Using the jpeg images, I pasted the 
images onto a canvas and animated certain areas using simple ctx tricks.

Elle, if you're reading this, I want you to know that I love you very very much. <3
